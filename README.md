# Deep Learning MNIST

Deep Learning with MNIST dataset

This is adapted from the tutorial of the MIT AI Research Scientist, Lex Fridman. It is the application of deep learning to make predictions on the MNIST dataset. So, we are to classify images of hand-written digits using Convolutional Neural Network Classifier. We will take one image out of the 70,000 images, at a resolution of 28 by 28 pixels, as input and predict the most likely digit in that image.
